Overview Dashboard
The Overview dashboard presents a high-level summary of business performance. It's a great starting point for understanding overall trends.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): The top section provides critical metrics at a glance:

Total Sales: The platform has generated $89.08M in total sales.

Sales Value: The total sales amount is also $89.08M, which is redundant with the Total Sales metric. This could be a formatting error.

Number of Brands: There are 5,988 different brands on the platform.

Number of Sellers: There are 2,404 sellers.

Number of Orders: The total number of orders is 120.38K.

Sales Distribution:

Sales by City: The bar chart shows that Bengaluru is the top-performing city with 8.2M in sales, followed by Hyderabad (6.3M) and Mumbai (5.0M). This indicates that sales are heavily concentrated in major metropolitan areas.

Sales by State: Correspondingly, the state-level data shows Maharashtra (16M), Karnataka (12M), and Tamil Nadu (8M) as the top three states by sales.

Sales Trends: The line chart at the bottom, "Sale by City," which seems to be mislabeled and actually shows a time-series trend of sales over a year, indicates a significant peak in sales around April 2022, with a value of $9,62,893.82. The trend shows a sharp decline from there, with sales bottoming out in the later part of the year. This requires further investigation to understand the cause of the peak and subsequent drop. It could be due to a seasonal event, a major marketing campaign, or a data collection anomaly.

Order Statuses: The filter pane on the left shows various order statuses, including Pending, Shipped, Delivered to buyer, and Returned to Seller. This is a valuable tool for monitoring fulfillment and logistics performance.

Products Dashboard
The Products dashboard shifts the focus to individual product performance. This view is ideal for product managers or marketing teams to identify best-selling items and analyze their metrics.

Product Grid: The main area displays a grid of various products, including clothing, belts, and accessories. This is likely a "browse" or "discovery" view.

Product Tooltip: When a user hovers over a product (as shown with the blue dress), a tooltip appears, providing a snapshot of its performance. This is an efficient way to get quick insights without navigating away.

Key Metrics: The tooltip for the "@499 Women's Off Shoulder S..." dress shows:

Sale Amount: $2.79K

Units: 4

Returns: 698.00 (This return value is unusually high and likely represents a return amount rather than unit count. If it is a unit count, a return rate of 698 units from 4 sold units is an error in data representation. The unit of measurement for returns needs to be clarified.)

Review: 7.00 (likely an average rating out of 10 or 5)

Sales Trend: The chart within the tooltip, "Units," shows the sales trend for this specific product over time. It indicates a decline in sales from May 2022 to June 2022. The U-shape of the graph with a dip in the middle suggests a temporary drop in sales, which could be due to a stock-out event, a change in marketing, or seasonal demand.

Product View Dashboard
The Product View dashboard provides a granular, single-product analysis. This is essential for deep-dive investigations into a specific item's performance.

Selected Product: The dashboard is currently focused on the "1 Stop Fashion Crepe Shirt Dress."

Product Metrics: The top section shows key performance indicators for this specific dress:

Sale Amount: $525.00

Units Sold: 3

Return Loss: 175 (Similar to the Products dashboard, the unit for this value is unclear. It's most likely a monetary loss due to returns.)

Reviews: 9 (The number of customer reviews)

Sales and Returns Trend: The large line graph titled "Units" shows a significant drop-off in sales for this dress, going from a high point in May 2022 to near-zero units in June 2022. This steep decline indicates a critical issue, such as:

Product Deprecation: The item may have been discontinued.

Stock-out: The product went out of stock and was not replenished.

Negative Feedback: A sudden influx of bad reviews or a drop in rating could have deterred buyers.

Listing Issue: The product listing may have been de-indexed or faced a technical issue.

The "Return Loss" of 175 is also a concern and should be cross-referenced with the low unit sales of 3 to understand its impact.
